LoomScriptXcode
===============

I just have created a sample project with xcode and Loom Script. For now, code completion is not working because still in development by me. To use code completion, set it with java language.

Using Xcode you can deploy without any problems to you android or osx (for now, I've not teste in ios).

After run your project, you can make changes in the code, and xcode update all the solution.

One problem that I still have is that xcode do not recognizes when you close the application (your game), so you need to use the stop command in xcode.
